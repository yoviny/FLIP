"""End-to-end smoke that drives a fresh project from creation to results-downloaded.

Replaces the manual UI loop a developer goes through when sanity-checking a PR:
create project, approve, upload model files, wait for image pull, initiate
training, wait for training to finish, download the FL results. Hits the same
flip-api endpoints the UI does, so it covers the API + trust + FL integration
paths without the fragility of UI selectors.

Backend-agnostic: the script uploads whatever files are in `--model-files-dir`,
and the FL framework (Flower vs NVFLARE) is decided server-side by `FL_BACKEND`
in flip-api's bundling code. `make e2e_smoke` picks the chest-xray tutorial
that matches FL_BACKEND — both tutorials are now in-tree under
fl-tutorials/<backend>/ (Flower at fl-tutorials/flower/, NVFLARE at
fl-tutorials/nvflare/). Both reuse the same `query.sql` against the trust mock
OMOP data. Override either path with `--model-files-dir` and `--query-file`.

Usage (preferred):
    make e2e_smoke                    # NVFLARE tutorial (default backend)
    make e2e_smoke FL_BACKEND=flower  # Flower tutorial

Direct invocation:
    cd flip-api
    uv run python -m tests.e2e_smoke \\
        --model-files-dir ../fl-tutorials/flower/xray_classification/app \\
        --query-file ../fl-tutorials/flower/xray_classification/query.sql

Run on a stack that already has trusts approved (`make up` plus the usual
seeding) and non-empty XNAT data so image pull has something to do.

Pass --abort-midway to verify the FL "stop training" path (GitHub issue #490)
instead of running to completion: once training is live, the smoke POSTs
/fl/stop/{model_id} twice and asserts both return HTTP 204 — the first aborts
the running job, the second is an idempotent no-op.
