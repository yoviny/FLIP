# Run one Flower tutorial on the flwr SIMULATOR — no SuperLink container, no SuperNodes, no
# fl-api, no Docker; flwr starts a local SuperLink of its own on 127.0.0.1. The NVFLARE
# counterpart is `make sim` in each nvflare tutorial dir; this gives the Flower tutorials the
# same fast local path.
#
#   make -C fl-tutorials sim-tutorial TUTORIAL=3d_spleen_segmentation FL_BACKEND=flower
#
# The tutorial's app code is byte-identical to a platform run. Identity comes from
# context.node_config's `partition-id` (which the simulator populates and a deployed
# SuperNode accepts via --node-config), resolved by flip.flower.identity.client_identity,
# so nothing in app/ knows which runtime it is in.
#
# For the container path — the pre-merge check that exercises TLS, fl-api submit and
# SuperNode registration — use run-tutorial.sh instead.
#
# Exit status is the RUN's: 0 only when the SuperLink reports it finished:completed.

# Deliberately NOT `pkill -f flower-superlink`: on a host running the FLIP dev stack that also
# matches deploy-fl-server-net-*'s superlink, because container processes are visible in the host
# PID namespace. Kill only processes that are (a) not in a container and (b) from this checkout.
# (a) compares PID namespaces rather than grepping /proc/<pid>/cgroup for a runtime-specific
# string: every container runtime gives its processes their own PID namespace, whereas the cgroup
# path spells "docker-<id>.scope" only under docker's systemd driver (the cgroupfs driver writes
# /docker/<id>, kubelet /kubepods/...). An unreadable namespace link (a root-owned container
# process) skips the pid, so the check fails closed. (b) matches this checkout's flip-utils venv
# path, not the bare checkout path — a worktree under .claude/worktrees/ starts with it too.
