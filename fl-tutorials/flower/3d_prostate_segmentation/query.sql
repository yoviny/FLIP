-- Every prostate bpMRI series (t2w, adc, hbv — one image_occurrence row each, sharing the study's
-- accession) with the per-study clinical facts prostate_project carries as observations, so a
-- cohort can be narrowed on them (e.g. add `AND c.cspca = 'Yes'` or `AND c.isup_grade_group >= 2`).
-- The segmentation labels themselves are not in OMOP: they arrive through XNAT data enrichment
-- (fl-tutorials/datasets/prostate/upload_prostate_labels_to_xnat.py).
