"""The pieces of the nnU-Net training recipe the ClientApp assembles around ``train_seg``.

``nnunet_train.py`` (kept at the tutorial root as reference) set all of this up inline in its
``train_loop``: read the plan for the crop / patch / spacing / normalisation numbers, build the loss
with nnU-Net's ``DeepSupervisionWrapper``, an SGD optimiser and a polynomial LR schedule. This
module is that setup, factored so ``client_app.py`` reads like a recipe, plus the one function the
port did not have — a per-volume evaluation for the test split.
