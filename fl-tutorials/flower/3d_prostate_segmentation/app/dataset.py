    """The transform chain that reads one study's image and two masks onto one grid.

    Image and masks are paired by affine, never by array index. On the platform the image an
    fl-client receives is dcm2niix output from XNAT, which stores each volume with the DICOM row
    axis reversed (dcm2niix's ``isFlipY``, on by default and not exposed in the command XNAT
    registers), while the PI-CAI masks uploaded at enrichment are in the ``.mha`` convention
    SimpleITK writes — the same voxels, the other row order. Each file's affine is correct, so
    reading both through ``Orientationd`` lands them on one grid; reading raw arrays mirrors the
    mask across the image's anterior-posterior midline (Dice 0.52 against its true position on
    10000_1000000). The simulator's own data goes through the same chain, so the two paths produce
    identical tensors — ``tests/test_prostate_dataset_orientation.py`` pins both.

    The zonal (HeviAI23) and whole-gland (Bosma22b) labels are independent AI submissions and do
    not always share a grid, so both masks are resampled onto the *image's* grid by affine
    (nearest, zero-padded — a label must not bleed past its own extent). When a mask already sits
    on that grid the resample is the identity.

    Args:
        target_spacing: If given, resample the image to this (x, y, z) voxel spacing in mm before
            the masks are matched to it, so both land on the resampled grid together. Must happen
            here, not in a later ``PicaiDataset(transform=...)`` step: ``PicaiDataset.__getitem__``
            converts the image to a plain tensor before calling ``transform``, which drops the
            affine a spacing-aware resample needs. Defaults to None (no resample, the image's own
            native spacing is kept) — the prior behaviour.

    Returns:
        mt.Compose: ``{IMAGE_KEY, WHOLE_GLAND_KEY, PZ_TZ_KEY}`` paths in; channel-first ``AXCODES``
