# Tutorial datasets

Shared download/derive/enrich tooling for the FL tutorial datasets. Datasets are
**backend-agnostic** — a tutorial's NVFLARE and Flower twins train on the same data — and
**many-to-one** — one dataset serves several tutorials (spleen alone backs segmentation,
evaluation and diffusion) — so their tooling lives here once instead of duplicated per
backend tree. Everything downloads at run time; nothing is committed.

All outputs land under the shared, gitignored [`fl-tutorials/data/`](../) root, so one
download serves both backends' harnesses (the NVFLARE simulator via each tutorial's
`.env.app`, the Flower compose stack via `flower/run-tutorial.sh`).

Invoke the targets through the fl-tutorials root Makefile (which forwards here):

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials download-xray-data
make -C fl-tutorials download-spleen-data              # MSD build (NUM_CASES=<1-41>, default 10)
make -C fl-tutorials download-spleen-checkpoint        # evaluation-tutorial checkpoint only
make -C fl-tutorials download-arkplus-finetuning-data  # large (~6.3 GB)
make -C fl-tutorials download-arkplus-eval-data        # (~1.6 GB)
make -C fl-tutorials download-synthea-data             # EHR tabular dataset (~5 MB, backend-agnostic)
make -C fl-tutorials upload-spleen-labels FLIP_PROJECT_ID=<uuid>   # data enrichment
make -C fl-tutorials download-weights ARCH=squeezenet1_1   # a pretrained backbone a tutorial ships beside its app
make -C fl-tutorials download-brain-mri-data NUM_CASES=10  # MSD Task01 brain MRI, simulator layout (7.6 GB download)
make -C fl-tutorials download-prostate-data            # PI-CAI (FOLDS="0 1 2 3 4" by default, ~5GB/fold)
make -C fl-tutorials convert-prostate-to-dicom
make -C fl-tutorials convert-prostate-to-nifti
make -C fl-tutorials partition-prostate-data
make -C fl-tutorials prepare-prostate-local-data NUM_CASES=12   # simulator layout (fold 0, no Docker) for 3d_prostate_segmentation
make -C fl-tutorials upload-prostate-labels FLIP_PROJECT_ID=<uuid> XNAT_URLS="…"   # data enrichment: both masks into XNAT
```

The prostate tutorial needs one more step after partitioning: a **dataset fingerprint** (per-case
voxel spacing, shape after cropping to the non-zero region, foreground intensity statistics) and
the **nnU-Net experiment plan** derived from it (target spacing, patch and batch size,
normalisation, U-Net topology). `make plan` in the tutorial directory runs the planner pooled over
every site and copies the plan into `app/nnUNetPlans_segmentation.json`, from which the app builds
its network — see
[`../flower/3d_prostate_segmentation/README.md`](../flower/3d_prostate_segmentation/README.md#nnu-net-plans)
for why the plan is pooled and the measured per-center figures.

| Dataset | Source | Output under `fl-tutorials/data/` | Consumed by |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| xray | HF `aicentreflip/flip-fl-base-test-data` | `xrays_mini_300/{accession-resources/, dataframe.csv}` | xray_classification (both backends) |
| spleen | MSD Task09_Spleen (`NUM_CASES`, default 10) | `spleen/{images/, dataframe.csv}` | 3d_spleen_segmentation + evaluation + latent_diffusion_model (**both backends**); enrichment labels |
| spleen checkpoint | HF `aicentreflip/flip-fl-base-test-data` | `model_checkpoints/model.pt` | 3d_spleen_segmentation_evaluation |
| brain_mri | MSD Task01_BrainTumour (`download-brain-mri-msd-raw`, 7.6 GB; `NUM_CASES` for the simulator layout) | `Task01_BrainTumour/`, `brain_mri/{images/, dataframe.csv, dicom/, source/, canonical/}` | the latent-diffusion tutorial once retargeted (FLIP#1221 follow-up); the mock trust data via `seed-brain-mri` |
| arkplus | HF `aicentreflip/tutorials-arkplus-cxr-classification` | `arkplus/site{1,2}[,_holdoff]/` | the three Ark+ tutorials (NVFLARE) |
| synthea | Synthea-in-OMOP, 1k persons (AWS Open Data Registry) | `synthea/{dataframe.csv, site{1,2}/dataframe.csv}` | ehr_risk_prediction (both backends); on the platform the same data goes into each trust's OMOP via `make -C trust load-synthea-ehr` |
| prostate | Zenodo PI-CAI + `picai_labels` (GitHub) | `prostate/{images/, labels/, zonal_labels/, clinical_information/, dicom/, nifti/, sites/<CENTER>/}` | 3d_prostate_segmentation (Flower) |
| weights | `download.pytorch.org` (torchvision checkpoints, sha256-prefix checked; `weights/fetch_weights.py` lists them) | `weights/<torchvision filename>` (flat, e.g. `squeezenet1_1-b8a52dc0.pth`) | latent_diffusion_model via its own `make weights`, which copies the file into `app_files/` to be uploaded with the app — FL apps never download at run time (FLIP#1206) |

One spleen tree serves both backends. `download-spleen-data` refuses to overwrite an
existing `data/spleen/images` — remove it first to rebuild at a different `NUM_CASES`.

## Per-dataset scripts

[`spleen/`](spleen/) owns the spleen scripts and their uv project (`pyproject.toml` — MONAI,
pandas, natsort; `uv.lock` is gitignored):

- `download_spleen_dataset.py` — fetch MSD spleen cases and reorganise each subject to hold
  image + label.
- `create_spleen_accession_csv.py` — build the `accession_id` dataframe the trainers read in
  LOCAL_DEV.
- `upload_spleen_labels_to_xnat.py` — the data-enrichment step: push `label_*.nii.gz` files
  into a real FLIP project's XNAT (see the
  [spleen tutorial README](../nvflare/image_segmentation/3d_spleen_segmentation/README.md)
  for the full walkthrough, and the repo-root `AGENTS.md` for its `e2e_smoke` wiring). Runs
  against the in-tree `flip-utils`, not `spleen/`'s env.
- `download_spleen_checkpoint.py` — fetch the evaluation-tutorial checkpoint from Hugging
  Face. A pure Hugging Face fetch, so like the xray/arkplus scripts it runs via
  `uv run --no-project --with huggingface_hub`, not in `spleen/`'s env.

[`cxr/`](cxr/) owns the `cxr_project` OMOP converter and its uv project (`pyproject.toml` —
pandas, pandera, sqlglot, tqdm; `uv.lock` is gitignored). It has no download script: the images
come from the private `londonaicentre/xraycat`, not from a public dataset. See
[OMOP mock-data generation](#omop-mock-data-generation-flip1092) below.

[`xrays_mini_300/`](xrays_mini_300/) owns the single x-ray script — no dedicated uv project,
it runs via `uv run --no-project --with huggingface_hub`, the same way `upload-spleen-labels`
runs against `flip-utils` without adopting `spleen/`'s env:

- `download_xrays_dataset.py` — fetch the Hugging Face snapshot and normalise it into
  `accession-resources/` + `dataframe.csv`.

[`arkplus/`](arkplus/) owns the single arkplus script — no dedicated uv project, it runs via
`uv run --no-project --with huggingface_hub`, the same way `upload-spleen-labels` runs
against `flip-utils` without adopting `spleen/`'s env:

- `download_arkplus_dataset.py` — fetch the given site folders (TRAIN or HOLD-OUT) from
  Hugging Face and normalise each into `accession-resources/` +
  `sample_get_dataframe_response.csv`. Parameterised by `--sites`, so one script backs both
  `download-arkplus-finetuning-data` and `download-arkplus-eval-data`.

[`synthea/`](synthea/) owns the single EHR script, in the smallest of the dataset uv projects
(pandas only — the project exists so its tests run in an environment declaring exactly what the
script imports, like the others):

- `build_synthea_dataframe.py` — fetch three OMOP tables (`person`, `condition_occurrence`,
  `visit_occurrence`) of the public Synthea-in-OMOP dataset and derive the EHR risk-prediction
  tutorial's feature dataframe: one row per person labelled with first type-2-diabetes diagnosis,
  plus `site1/`/`site2/` `person_id`-modulo splits. Its feature logic mirrors the tutorial's
  `query.sql` (the OMOP SQL a deployed run sends to each trust) — change one and change the other
  (see the [EHR tutorial README](../nvflare/tabular_classification/ehr_risk_prediction/README.md)).
  `tests/datasets/synthea/` keeps the two honest: it runs the actual `query.sql` on SQLite over the
  same tiny tables and diffs it against `derive_features` row for row.

[`prostate/`](prostate/) owns the prostate download/preprocessing scripts. The dataset class that
reads this data lives with the tutorial instead, at
`../flower/3d_prostate_segmentation/app/dataset.py`, as does the nnU-Net planning step above:

- `download_data.py` — fetch the PI-CAI bpMRI images + whole-gland/zonal labels + clinical
  marksheet from Zenodo/GitHub (`FOLDS` narrows which of the 5 ~5GB fold zips to fetch).
- `convert_mha_to_dicom.py` — convert the downloaded `.mha` scans to a DICOM series per study.
- `convert_dicom_to_nifti.py` — convert those DICOM series to `.nii.gz` with the platform's own
  pinned dcm2niix image (read from `trust/xnat/xnat/config/dcm2niix_command.json`), so the
  simulator trains on the same bytes an fl-client gets from XNAT. Needs Docker.
- `partition_by_center.py` — split the converted NIfTI scans + labels into one folder per
  acquiring center (RUMC/PCNN/ZGT), ready for `PicaiDataset` per simulated FL client. Re-running
  it repairs stale symlinks, so it is safe over an existing `sites/` tree.
- `create_prostate_metadata_table.py`, `omop_convert_prostate.py` — the `prostate_project` OMOP
  tables for the trust seed pipeline (see "Prostate" under the OMOP section below), and
  `upload_prostate_labels_to_xnat.py` — the data-enrichment step that puts both PI-CAI masks
  beside every pulled image in XNAT.
## OMOP mock-data generation (FLIP#1092)

The mock OMOP CDM data that backs the tutorials — and the trust `omop-db` seed data it feeds —
is generated in-tree, per dataset. Four projects are covered: `spleen_project` and
`brain_mri_project` (the whole chain, from a public MSD download; their DICOM sets regenerate
locally and are never published), `cxr_project` (the OMOP conversion only; see below for why) and
`prostate_project` (the whole chain, from the PI-CAI download, DICOM set published).
All share one contract in [`utils/`](utils/) and one verification gate.

### Where the DICOMs live (FLIP#1221)

MSD Task09_Spleen and Task01_BrainTumour are open data, so FLIP does not re-host DICOMs cut from
them. What `aicentreflip/trust-data` carries for those two projects is **the OMOP tables and the
metadata table they were built from** (`omop-csv/<project>/`, `omop-csv/<project>/source/`); the
DICOM set is regenerated on demand from the MSD archive by a deterministic converter
(`utils/dicom_writer.py` — every UID, date and identity a pure function of the case id, so two
runs anywhere write the same bytes) and seeded into a trust from the local tree. `cxr_project`
still ships a `dicom/cxr_project.tar.gz`: its images come from a private generative model and have
no public source to regenerate from.

The regenerated tree is verified against the canonical tables both ways before it is used
(`verify-<dataset>-dicom`: every accession, study UID and patient present on both sides, no
accession spanning two studies, no duplicate SOPInstanceUID) — the pre-publish check
`trust/orthanc/publish_dicom.py` runs, minus the packaging — and `seed-<dataset> KIT=<CODE>` loads
both halves of a running dev trust from the local tree: the OMOP rows from `canonical/`
(`make -C trust seed-omop … CANONICAL_DIR=`) and the instances from the DICOM tree
(`make -C trust seed-orthanc … DICOM_SOURCE= TABLES_DIR=`, read in any layout and grouped by the
`AccessionNumber` tag). That is also how a project is proven on the platform *before* its data
version is tagged: tags are immutable, so the tables are only published once a pull has passed on
them.

### Spleen: the full chain

Generated by a four-step chain (the metadata and OMOP steps vendored from
`flip_project_spleen_segmentation` and `flip-omop-mock-data`; the DICOM step on the shared writer)
plus the MSD download itself:

1. **Download** the raw MSD Task09_Spleen archive (`download-spleen-msd-raw` — NOT the same
   download as `download-spleen-data` above; this one reads/writes the raw MSD layout
   `data/Task09_Spleen/imagesTr`, not the FLIP accession-resources layout).
2. **NIfTI → DICOM** (`convert-spleen-to-dicom`), one CT series per subject under
   `dicom_output/<subject>/`, with a synthetic patient identity derived from the subject id
   (`utils/synthetic_identity.py`). Deterministic, no root, no binaries: it used to call
   plastimatch, which needed root to install and minted fresh UIDs on every run — the reason the
   spleen DICOMs had to be re-hosted before FLIP#1221.
3. **DICOM → metadata table** (`create-spleen-metadata-table`), writing
   `tables/dicom_metadata.csv` and copying it to `data/spleen_metadata.csv` where the next
   step expects it — this copy stands in for a manual step upstream.
4. **Metadata table → OMOP tables** (`build-spleen-omop-tables`), writing
   `omop/<trust>/spleen_project/*.csv`.

There is also a **reproducible path** that skips steps 1-2 entirely:
`fetch-spleen-metadata-table` downloads the *published* metadata table for the pinned
`trust/.data_version` (no 1.5GB MSD download) straight into `data/spleen_metadata.csv`, ready
for step 4. `reproduce-spleen-omop` chains `fetch-spleen-metadata-table` →
`build-spleen-omop-tables` → `verify-spleen-omop-tables` in one command. Since the FLIP#1221 cut
the published export *is* the deterministic chain's output, so the two paths agree; before it, the
regeneration path could not reproduce the plastimatch-era export and was only good for exercising
the DICOM stage. `verify-spleen-omop-tables` (`utils/verify_omop_tables.py --project
spleen_project`) is the faithfulness check: it diffs the locally generated tables against the
published ones for the pinned data version and prints a `MATCH`/`DIFF` per table, exiting non-zero
on any divergence. Re-run it after a `.data_version` bump or after any change to the converter or
the shared schemas. The gate excuses a published-only column only when it is empty in the published
export — the `20260729` spleen tables carried five such (`wadors_uri` on `image_occurrence`;
`alg_datetime`, `alg_system`, `image_finding_concept_id`, `image_finding_id` on `image_feature`),
later republishes none — and a published-only column carrying data still fails the gate.

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials fetch-spleen-metadata-table   # reproducible path, step 1
make -C fl-tutorials build-spleen-omop-tables       # reproducible path, step 2
make -C fl-tutorials verify-spleen-omop-tables      # faithfulness gate
make -C fl-tutorials reproduce-spleen-omop          # the three above, chained
make -C fl-tutorials download-spleen-msd-raw        # regeneration path, step 1 (large)
make -C fl-tutorials convert-spleen-to-dicom        # regeneration path, step 2 (deterministic; no root)
make -C fl-tutorials create-spleen-metadata-table   # regeneration path, step 3
make -C fl-tutorials build-spleen-canonical         # -> data/spleen/canonical/spleen_project (the published form)
make -C fl-tutorials verify-spleen-dicom            # dicom_output/ <-> canonical tables, both ways
make -C fl-tutorials seed-spleen KIT=GSTT           # both halves of a RUNNING dev trust from the local tree
```

**Output feeds `trust/omop-db`**: the generated `omop/<trust>/spleen_project/*.csv` tables
are exactly the per-trust layout `trust/omop-db`'s `build_canonical` (assembles the canonical
dataset from per-trust project directories) and `import_tables` (loads a trust's slice into
its OMOP database) expect as input — see `trust/omop-db/README.md`.

**Moving a trust that holds the pre-FLIP#1221 spleen cut.** Every spleen identity, accession and
UID changed at that cut, so `seed-omop`'s default `--clean projects` (which deletes by the *new*
person ids) would leave the old rows beside the new ones. Once, pass `CLEAN=all` and every project
the trust holds so they are all reloaded (`make -C fl-tutorials seed-spleen KIT=GSTT CLEAN=all`
reloads spleen; then `make -C trust seed-omop KIT=GSTT PROJECTS=cxr_project` for the rest) and
`CLEAR=1` on the PACS half. There are no volume snapshots to re-cut: since FLIP#1190 a bring-up
seeds from the dataset at the pinned version (`make -C trust ensure-seeded`), and the projects it
seeds by default are the ones that publish a DICOM set — spleen and brain_mri are not among them.

### Brain MRI: the same chain, four MR series per study

[`brain_mri/`](brain_mri/) is the MSD Task01_BrainTumour twin of the spleen chain — one MR study of
four series (FLAIR, T1w, T1Gd, T2w) per case, flat under its accession, and a per-series metadata
table with `source_trust` decided there. Its README covers the targets, the published cohort (the
first 40 cases, 20 per trust) and how the platform pull was proven; the chain is the same shape as
spleen's, with `download-brain-mri-msd-raw` → `convert-brain-mri-to-dicom` →
`create-brain-mri-metadata-table` → `build-brain-mri-omop-tables` → `build-brain-mri-canonical` →
`verify-brain-mri-dicom` → `seed-brain-mri`, and `reproduce-brain-mri-omop` as the reproducible path.

### CXR: the OMOP conversion only

[`cxr/`](cxr/) carries `omop_convert_cxr.py` and its own uv project. Only the **conversion** is
here: the chest X-rays themselves are generated by a synthetic model that lives outside this
repo, in [`londonaicentre/xraycat`](https://github.com/londonaicentre/xraycat) (private — org
members only), along with the DICOM write and the metadata extraction. That is the scope
FLIP#1092 set, since those images do not come from a public dataset the way MSD spleen does.

So the provenance chain recorded here starts at the DICOM metadata table, published beside its
outputs at `omop-csv/cxr_project/source/dicom_metadata.csv` on `aicentreflip/trust-data`, read at
the pinned data-version tag.
There is no regeneration path to offer and no root needed:

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials fetch-cxr-metadata-table       # the published canonical input
make -C fl-tutorials build-cxr-omop-tables          # -> omop/<trust>/cxr_project/*.csv
make -C fl-tutorials verify-cxr-omop-tables         # faithfulness gate
make -C fl-tutorials reproduce-cxr-omop             # the three above, chained
```

cxr has never needed a published-only column excusal: the two exports were produced by different
scripts against different schema subsets, and nothing is relaxed for either.

Two shape differences from spleen, both inherited from what the dataset is:

- cxr publishes **`observation`** where spleen publishes **`measurement`**. Spleen's per-image
  features are DICOM tags (slice thickness and the like), so they are measurements; cxr's are
  findings read out of a synthetic radiology report, so each becomes an `image_feature` paired with
  an `observation` carrying an explicit yes/no. A negated finding is published as a "no", not as a
  missing row.
- cxr's `image_feature_id` / `observation_id` are **derived, not allocated** — the
  `image_occurrence_id` with a two-digit finding index appended, which puts them around 100,000,000,
  outside every project's reserved block in `utils/omop_ids.py`. Nothing collides today, but do not
  assume that band is reserved. It is annotated at the line that builds it.

### Prostate: a cohort published from the fold download

[`prostate/`](prostate/) is the third converter and the first cohort published for the trust
**seed pipeline** alone (`make -C trust seed`, FLIP#1100) — there is no pgdata/Orthanc snapshot of
it, the trusts load it from `omop-csv/prostate_project/` and `dicom/prostate_project.tar.gz` on
the dataset. The chain starts at a public download (PI-CAI fold 0, 300 bpMRI studies) rather than
at a private generator, so unlike cxr every stage is in-tree and reproducible:

```bash
make -C fl-tutorials download-prostate-data FOLDS="0"     # regeneration path, step 1 (5 GB)
make -C fl-tutorials convert-prostate-to-dicom            # step 2: t2w/adc/hbv -> DICOM series (SeriesNumber set, synthetic identity)
make -C fl-tutorials create-prostate-metadata-table       # step 3: data/prostate/source/{dicom_metadata,marksheet}.csv
make -C fl-tutorials fetch-prostate-metadata-table        # reproducible path: the published source/ tables instead
make -C fl-tutorials build-prostate-omop-tables           # -> data/prostate/omop/{prostate_project,trust_1,trust_2}/
make -C fl-tutorials verify-prostate-omop-tables          # faithfulness gate
make -C fl-tutorials reproduce-prostate-omop              # fetch + build + verify
make -C fl-tutorials build-prostate-canonical             # the source_trust form to publish (+ source/ beside it)
make -C fl-tutorials package-prostate-dicom               # verified both ways against those tables -> tar.gz
```

Three shape differences from the other two, each inherited from what the dataset is:

- **`source_trust` is one contributing center per trust** (ZGT → 1, PCNN → 2, RUMC → 3), decided
  in the metadata table from `ClinicalTrialSiteID`, never by row index and never by merging
  centers. The two dev trusts take the two centers closest in size (76 and 69 studies); RUMC's
  155 are published as source 3 and wait for a third trust — the seed loader accepts a dataset
  with more sources than the stack has trusts. An unknown center is an error.
- **One `image_occurrence` per series.** A study is three series (t2w, adc, hbv) sharing one
  accession, visit and procedure; spleen and cxr are single-series studies.
- **The marksheet is published as clinical rows** — PSA, PSA density, prostate volume as
  `measurement`; ISUP grade group, csPCa and PI-RADS as `observation` — so a cohort query can
  narrow on them. The masks are not in OMOP; `upload_prostate_labels_to_xnat.py` is the
  enrichment step, and the identity of accession and label stem means it fetches nothing.

`person_id` is PI-CAI's numeric `patient_id` (five digits), clear of the nine-digit NHS-number
prefixes of spleen/cxr and of Synthea's band. PI-CAI is **CC BY-NC 4.0** (images and labels),
which the dataset card records — the prostate-derived content is the one non-commercial part of
`aicentreflip/trust-data`.

### The shared contract

[`utils/`](utils/) holds what every dataset's converter agrees on, and nothing that is a property
of one dataset:

- `omop_schemas.py` — the OMOP CDM 5.4 table schemas, cached as committed YAML under
  `utils/schemas/` and regenerated from the upstream DDL with `python omop_schemas.py --regenerate`
  (the only path that needs network).
- `omop_mappings.py` — concept-ID mappings, plus the handful of scalar concept ids more than one
  converter uses.
- `omop_ids.py` — the per-project surrogate-key blocks (`cxr_project` 1M, `spleen_project` 2M,
  `prostate_project` 3M, `brain_mri_project` 5M; 4M is `pathology_project`'s, FLIP#1181). All
  projects load into the same trust database, so these must not collide. `person_id` is
  deliberately *not* blocked: it derives from a synthetic NHS number.
- `dicom_writer.py` — the deterministic NIfTI → DICOM series writer (pydicom + nibabel) the spleen
  and brain MRI converters share: RAS affine → LPS geometry, MR pixels unsigned / CT as signed HU,
  every UID from `generate_uid(entropy_srcs=…)` over the caller's stable identifiers, no wall clock.
- `synthetic_identity.py` — the synthetic patient population, every value a pure function of a
  case id (NHS mod-11 numbers, RFC 3986-safe `FAK…` accessions, names, dates, sites, scanners).
- `verify_omop_tables.py` — the verification gate, shared because nothing in it is dataset-specific.
  `--project` selects which published export to diff against; tables a project does not publish are
  skipped, and a run that compares *nothing* fails rather than passing vacuously. The gate is the
  provenance claim: the output of the run that backed each published tag is recorded in the PR that
  published it, not in a committed log (a run record goes stale at the next tag). A `DIFF` or
  `GATE FAIL` on a re-run means a real regression in a converter or published data that no longer
  matches the code — investigate and resolve, don't relax the gate to match.

Converters import this as `utils.*`, which is why the Make recipes set `PYTHONPATH=datasets` when
invoking them — `python datasets/<name>/x.py` puts `datasets/<name>` on `sys.path`, never
`datasets/`.

What deliberately does *not* live here: which tags a dataset stamps, and the anatomy it depicts.
Those are properties of the dataset — spleen and brain MRI *mock* `Manufacturer` and
`InstitutionName` from the shared tables; prostate (FLIP#1091) carries real ones recovered from
the PI-CAI `.mha` headers.
